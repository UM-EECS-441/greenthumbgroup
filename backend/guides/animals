Animals such as deer and groundhogs can do considerable damage to your garden if allowed access to it, but luckily this can largely be prevented. Proper fencing of your garden to keep deer out, though, usually requires 8 foot tall fencing, which is certainly not a trivial task. An alternative to fencing to stop deers specifically is using deer repellants, which require regular application to work, but are largely successful in repelling deer. To keep groundhogs and other rodents out of your gardens a chicken wire fence that starts about 8 inches to a foot underground is best so as to keep them from digging under it.
