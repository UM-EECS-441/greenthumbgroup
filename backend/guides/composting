Composting is a great way to help your garden while being environmentally conscious at the same time. Turn your food waste, grass clippings, fallen leaves and more into food for your plants. The key to making the best compost is the correct ratio of 'greens', 'browns', and water. Greens are compost ingredients that are high in nitrogen, examples include grass clippings, food waste, and weeds. Avoid putting animal products (although egg shells are ok) or fats/oils into your compost. Browns are lower ingredients that are lower in nitrogen, common examples include fallen leaves, wood chips, and sawdust. The finer the material the faster the compost will form, so wood chips should be shredded if possible. Ideally your compost pile will have 2-3 parts browns to greens, which often causes finding enough browns to be a challenge. Finally, watering your compost pile speeds up the decomposition. Aim for a moist but not soggy pile. Now all there's left to do is wait and let nature take its course until you are rewarded with some quality home-grown compost to feed your plants with!
