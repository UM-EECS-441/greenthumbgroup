Different plants require very different levels of both light intensity and light duration, ranging from indoor plants like ferns that require little sun to outdoor plants like sunflowers that love the sun. While both light intensity and light duration are important, it turns out that the latter has a greater impact on the growing conditions of the plant. Our app allows you both to input the light duration for each plant in your garden, as well as to measure the intensity of sunlight to best help you plan out where to place each plant.
