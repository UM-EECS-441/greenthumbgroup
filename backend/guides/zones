It's important to know your USDA hardiness zone so that you can identify which plants can be grown in your location. There are 13 USDA plant hardiness zones, visit the USDA website (https://planthardiness.ars.usda.gov/PHZMWeb/Default.aspx) to find which zone you're in. Once you know your zone, you can then refer to guides for specific plants to see what zones they thrive in and determine whether or not you can grow them.
