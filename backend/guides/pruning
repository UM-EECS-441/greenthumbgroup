Pruning -- not just for aesthetics -- is the removal of dead and overgrown branches and stems in order to promote growth and fruitfulness. Many different kinds of plants can benefit from pruning, and the best way to identify what to prune is to look for yellow and brown sections on the plant to trim. Careful not to overprune though. When in doubt simply let the plant be, pruning is a less essential facet of gardenening when compared with water and light.
