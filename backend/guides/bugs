Bugs can cause wreak havoc in a garden. They can damage and even kill plants, and if you don't know the right techniques then they're impossible to deal with. The first such technique is to plant marigolds, whose smell repels mosquitoes and nematodes while at the same time actually attracting good bugs that eat aphids. In fact there are many such plants which attract good bugs that eat other bugs, for example dill attracts ladybugs and spearmint attracts pirate and damsel bugs. Another option is to place some physical barrier between the bugs and plants, for instance a floating row cover, although care must be taken to remove such covers when the plants are flowering to allow for pollination. Other than these options, the best way to deal with bugs in your garden is just to make sure your plants stay as healthy as possible through proper watering and use of fertilizer as a healthy plant deals better with bugs.
