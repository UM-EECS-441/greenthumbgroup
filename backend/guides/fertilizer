Fertilizer is a slightly more advanced, although not incredibly complicated, way to improve the care of your plants. The core idea behind fertilizing is to achieve the optimal levels of Nitrogen, Phosphorus, and Potassium in your soil, which is done by selecting fertilizer with the correct N-P-K (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, and Potassium) ratio for your garden. The best way to determine the content of your soil is to send a sample away to a laboratory, but generally Nitrogen promotes construction of chlorophyll (which allows plants to photosynthesize), Phosphorus promotes root growth, and Potassium increases a plant's durability and vigor.
