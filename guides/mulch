The purpose of mulch is multifold, but generally it consists of increasing retention of water in the soil, supression of weeds by severing their connection with the sun, controlling the temperature of the soil, and of course aiding the aesthetics of your garden. Lots of types of mulch exist, but their base material is usually compost, straw, hay, wood chips, or grass clippings. In general mulch is best used simply by spreading a 2-4 inch layer over top of the already-weeded soil in your garden.
