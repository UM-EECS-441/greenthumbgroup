Watering is a critical component of gardening and is often the cause of problems among novice gardeners. The best way to determine whether or not it's time to water your plants it to physically check the soil's moisture. While specific plants may require more specialized care, if the soil feels dry to you then you should water it. If, on the other hand, you find your soiling to be excessively damp, considering waiting to add more water until the soil has dried. Ideally watering should take place in the morning so that the foliage dries off quicker as wet foliage is a potential source of plant disease.
