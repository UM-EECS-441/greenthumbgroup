Gardening tools overview

Gardening doesn't require too many tools to get the job done, but there are a wide array of tools you can incorporate that will save you a lot of time.

Wheelbarrow
- While perhaps not necessary for a small garden, a wheelbarrow is very useful for moving around soil, mulch, and harvested plants without breaking your back.

Gloves
- Whether or not gloves are necessary is up for debate, there certainly is something to getting your hands into the dirt that feels more authentic. On the other hand, gloves are a great way to prevent blisters and cuts, as well as just keeping your hands clean.

Trowel
- A trowel is basically a mini shovel, and makes the creation of small holes to plant seeds in fast and easy. Trowels are also quite useful for digging things up, especially pesky weeds whose roots break off when you attempt to remove them.

Hand Pruner
- Like a modified pair of scissors, hand pruners allow for the easy removal of the dead and overgrown parts of your plants. This is a lower priority tool as pruning is often not necessary, although it's certainly quite a time save for intermediate and advanced gardeners.

Watering can
- For smaller gardens, a watering can is the easiest way to water your plants.

Hose
- A hose can save a lot of time watering in a mid-sized garden. Just attach it to a tap on the outside (or even inside) of your house, and then no more reason for multiple watering trips!

Sprinkler
- An alternative to a hose or watering can, a sprinkler can be set up to water all of the plants in your garden at once, saving lots of time.
